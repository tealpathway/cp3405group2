<h2>External php Libraries (i.e. Dependencies) </h2>
<p>
Dependencies are to be managed by <A href="http://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> 
</p>
<p>
Composer relies on: 
<ol>
<li>a "vendor" directory containing php class files and modules</li>
<li>a "composer.json" file with references to any required files in /vendor</li>
</ol>
When new php classes are used by the app, entries are added to composer.json and a command is run to update the vendor/ datastore.  The datastore can be rebuilt from the definitions recorded in composer.json, so only it needs to be checked into the selected version control system (in out=r case, git on github).  The .gitignore file should be used to exclude any files under vendor/
</p>

<h2>Custom php modules and libraries</h2>
<p>
Any php modules and classes specifically written for the app should be placed in the app/ subdirectory these can be referenced by files in the root of the app directory.
